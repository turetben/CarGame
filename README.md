# CarGame

Hi, I'm Ben. I'm learning how to code with [Code Connects](https://codeconnects.org/index.html). 
This is my repository where I will follow along with [this tutorial](https://coderslegacy.com/python/python-pygame-tutorial/) to make a car game. 
I'll update this readme in the future with more information when I'm finished.
